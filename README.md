//This is just a test file. If you guys want to practice making changes and commiting them, feel free to use this file.

//Make sure you understand when to use branches and when to commit to the master repo

//Note the 'Commit Changes' section underneath gives you options. And always make sure to include a relevant description of anything you're adding or have changed.

//Am I doing this right ?

//Yep. This is the basic idea anyway. Eventually we'll include all of our separate files and stuff and we can all see and edit them from here
