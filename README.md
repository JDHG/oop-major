//This is just a test file. If you guys want to practice making changes and commiting them, feel free to use this file.

//Make sure you understand when to use branches and when to commit to the master repo

//Note the 'Commit Changes' section underneath gives you options. And always make sure to include a relevant description of anything you're adding or have changed.

//Am I doing this right ?

//Yep. This is the basic idea anyway. Eventually we'll include all of our separate files and stuff and we can all see and edit them from here

//We can also break away from the base code by creating a branch and working in here. This way the master code copy doesn't need to be messed with while we are working on it

//So I can edit this file separetely by creating a branch.
//After editing, create a pull request to have it merged into the master code.
//And if we're all happy it can be merged into the main code body.
