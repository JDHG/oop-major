USE BRANCHES WHEN WORKING ON PRE-EXISTING FILES

    Click on the 'Branch:<branch_name>' button next to the 'New pull request' button.
    
    Type the name of the branch you wish to create and click 'Create branch:<new_branch_name>'.
    
    This creates a CLONE of everything in master in the new branch.
    (You may notice a message at the top of the files saying "This branch is even with master")
    
    You can find this branch in the 'branches' folder of your svn checkout of the repo (in your terminal).
    
    You can now safely work in this branch folder and svn commit changes to your heart's content.
      (DO NOT WORK IN THE TRUNK FOLDER WHENEVER POSSIBLE)
      
    After commiting changes to your working branch, a 'Compare & pull request' button will appear.
    Click this when your changes are complete and working and are now ready to merge back into the project.
    
    If your branch is able to be merged, it will tell you it is ok to create a pull request.
      Note the branches being merged are shown just above the comments panel:
      ( base:original_branch(probably master)  <-  compare:branch_with_your_new_changes )
    You can also request reviews if you want others to check the files before they are merged.
    Click 'Create pull request' when ready.
    
    There is now a new pull request open in the repository. This can be viewed and any changes that are to be merged can be
     looked over so we can all be happy before including the changes to the master files.
    
    If we all work in branches and only commit fully functional code (not necessarily complete, but has been tested and has no      errors) then this will keep us all up to date with the master branch as master could be updated by anyone at any time.
